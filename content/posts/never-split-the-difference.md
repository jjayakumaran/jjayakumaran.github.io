This is a book on negotiation written by Chris Voss, an expert in negotiation skills who has been teaching the same in B-Schools and Corporations. The book is an interesting collection of anecdotes where the author’s negotiation skills have helped him tackle crucial conversations during his career at FBI as a negotiator. Each chapter goes into depth on each technique that the author has developed over the years. It is an interesting read for anyone looking for a mental model to approach difficult conversations. Whether it is a bargain with a car salesman or an emotional conversation with your partner, these techniques can be useful when applied right. 

It would be a grave injustice to condense these techniques into a few sentences, but I am going to try to consolidate a few of my key takeaways. 

1. Mirroring: This is a strategy to hint similarity, which facilitates bonding. It involves repeating the last 3 (or more) words that your counterpart said.
2. Label: Put a label to the perceived emotion of the counterpart and address their concerns to gain trust
3. No’s are powerful than Yes’s. Don’t try to get easy Yes’s in your conversation.
4. “That’s right” is a good place to reach in a negotiation. It is more powerful than “Yes”
5. Meeting halfway is seemingly a good place to reach, but it is better to not split the difference and get a bad deal for both parties.
6. People take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain
7. Give the illusion of control by asking more questions
8. Bargain hard - Use Ackerman’s model of bargaining when you talk numbers

Communication is probably the most difficult soft skill to improve. Although many are blessed by the gift of gab, more often than not, it is an acquired, polished skill that requires continuous honing. Consider it a skill that always requires up-skilling and approach it in a methodical way has been my main takeaway from this book.
