<span class=tag><a href=/tags/books/>books</a></span></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is so popular and in almost everyone’s to-read list that I waited for months for it to come back in-stock on amazon but finally, the hold placed on a copy at my nearest library a few months ago paid off. I landed this minimalist hardcover book which just has a human thumbprint on front cover three weeks back. The book is about how homo sapiens (which also means wise men) got to where we are today and how we are leaving our fingerprints on the planet just like the one on the book’s cover. It is quite a long read at roughly 420 pages and took me nearly three weeks to complete. 400 pages may not be much but there is so much information contained in each chapter, that after my first read I think I might have absorbed only 40% of the complete essence of the book.</p><p>The history of humankind has been narrated as a very simple story, split into four parts:</p><ol><li>Cognitive Revolution</li><li>Agricultural Revolution</li><li>The Unification of Human Kind</li><li>The Scientific Revolution</li></ol><p>I wanted to highlight a few of the interesting ideas/facts that I learnt from this book.</p><h3 id=the-men-who-were-too-familiar-to-ignore-but-too-different-to-tolerate>The men who were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate
<a class=heading-link href=#the-men-who-were-too-familiar-to-ignore-but-too-different-to-tolerate><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>The general goal of the part Cognitive Revolution is to explain how humans today are different from other primates in terms of cognitive traits. The books starts with the story of other evolved men who shared the space with our ancestors like Neanderthals and Denisovans. They belonged to the same genus “Homo” as us, but as Harari quoted – “they were too familiar to ignore but too different to tolerate.” The question of what happened to these men over 40,000 years ago is tried to explain through the invasion and inter-breeding theories.</p><p>Fun fact : 1-4 per cent of the unique human DNA in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. Imagine your ancestors making love with a different species. Creepy, right? 😉</p><p>Neanderthals were not the only one species to have wiped out by us – Harari talks about Mammoths, Lemurs, Sloths and so on in later part of the book. So what made us stand out?</p><ul><li>Brain – Our super evolved brains that accounts for about 2-3 per cent of the total body weight and consumes 25 per cent of our energy when the body is at rest.</li><li>Language – So we are not the only species who can communicate, right? Studies show that monkeys can send signals to each other when there is an approaching predator and so on. But our language is more supple. We can connect a set of sounds and signs to produce infinite combination of sentences. While monkeys can talk among themselves and convey messages just enough for survival, we can talk about our feelings, thoughts, ideas and so on. Our ability to express beyond facts is a major advantage that we got against all other organisms.</li><li>Body – There is this interesting idea of how human babies are born prematurely compared to other organisms. Human babies have under-developed vital systems compared to a kitten. They are helpless and require many years until they can live independently. So why did this happen? Natural selection picked earlier birth for humans. Death of women during child birth was very common and it was better when they gave birth at an earlier stage when the baby’s brain was lighter and less developed.</li></ul><h3 id=dual-reality-system-created-by-humans>Dual Reality System created by Humans
<a class=heading-link href=#dual-reality-system-created-by-humans><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Watching this ted-talk by the writer before reading the book helped me in wrapping my head around this dual reality system that Humans follow. While for other species, there exists only a single reality – the objective reality, humans have this insane ability to have a fictional reality too. We can create fiction and believe in those. Money is a very simple example of the lengths to which we can believe in a story that’s created by our ancestors and we adhere to, without questioning it. It’s a paper with no value in objective reality. But in our fictional reality, we would die for it. Diamond is just another stone but we humans have built stories around it, making it an invaluable stone priced at millions. Harari cites the example of Limited Liability Company – Peugeot as an example of the fictions we create. This company is treated like an independent person by our Legal Systems. This imagined reality is a foundation of our modern human society. Gods, Demons, Nation, Money, Mortgage. These two parallel realities together make up our life as we see today.</p><p>Now we have this imagined reality and imagined order in it. Harari in his video and somewhere in the book talks about how a bunch of apes left in a stadium would cause nothing but chaos. Meanwhile, a bunch of humans in a stadium can maintain order and peacefully hang out together. What makes us believe in the system and maintain this order ? What’s preventing a majority of us to deviate from the “normal” stuff like religion, democracy, capitalism etc?</p><ol><li>The imagined order is embedded in the material world</li></ol><p>Ideas that we believe in is not just in our head, but it also intrudes into objective reality sometimes. Harari talks about this by drawing parallels between architecture and human stature. Today there is a huge importance given to individualism. Students are taught to be individualistic and having an opinion on everything is considered to be a matter of intellectual superiority somehow. Many of us are inspired by Ayn Rand’s philosophies on individualism. Now this can be seen in the way modern architecture is. Everyone has independent, private spaces in a house, including kids. Our real worth is seen to be coming from within, rather than from external factors. Now if you look at medieval noblemen, someone’s worth is judged by their place in social hierarchy rather than what they feel from within. Castles those days often had no private rooms for children and people cared about what others thought of them. Growing up in an environment like that would normally make the kids feel that their worth is depending on how others see them.</p><ol start=2><li>The imagined order shapes our desires</li></ol><p>Who defines our desires? Most of the millennials today want to follow their heart and travel the world. Passion is what people live for and die for. When human beings were mere foragers, did they have such ideas? They only cared about surviving, finding food, and staying safe from wild animals. One of my favorite teachers from school used to say – “Either you can merely exist or you can live your life”. I found this to be motivating as a child but now in retrospect, what’s the right way to live? We emphasize so much on experiencing different moments in life – from falling in love to literally falling in bungee jumping. Romanticism tells us that it’s important to experience love, good relationships, music, art, culture, tastes etc. Consumerism on the other hand, defines our happiness as the pleasure of purchasing things that we don’t need in the first place. So if you think of it, all our wants come from the way this imagined order.</p><ol start=3><li>The imagined order is inter-subjective</li></ol><p>I don’t want to go in deep into this point. But the idea is that one rebel doesn’t make any difference in the way our imagined order run. Simultaneously billions of people should change the consciousness to change the imagined order.</p><h3 id=when-wheat-domesticated-humans>When wheat domesticated humans
<a class=heading-link href=#when-wheat-domesticated-humans><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Agriculture revolution is called history’s biggest fraud in the second part of book. It brought in one of the biggest change in sapiens’ lifestyle. We transformed from foragers to settlers. This take on how a wild grass made our ancestors to spend their lives taking care of it is rather amusing.</p><h3 id=our-pace-of-growth-is-exponential>Our pace of growth is exponential
<a class=heading-link href=#our-pace-of-growth-is-exponential><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>There is this interesting concept of how we are learning faster. There was a gap of 600 years between Chinese alchemists discovering gunpowder and the first artillery being made. But there was only 40 years between Einstein’s discovery of E=mc^2 and the moment atom bombs obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><h3 id=meaningless-life-is-a-terrible-ordeal-no-matter-how-comfortable-its>Meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it’s
<a class=heading-link href=#meaningless-life-is-a-terrible-ordeal-no-matter-how-comfortable-its><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Well well … the meaning and purpose of life is a topic that’s discussed over and over again. This is not something that I learnt anew but it’s a message that’s re-iterated here.</p><p>I am only scratching the surface here, the book has so many of these fascinating ideas that would make you introspect and appreciate the beautiful world around, leaving you ponder about the journey of our species.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
