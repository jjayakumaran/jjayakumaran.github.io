First published in Hebrew and later in English. In my <a href=homo-deus.md>previous post</a>, I tried to highlight a few important takeaways from Harari’s first book – Sapiens: A brief history of humankind. Homo Deus is not a sequel to Sapiens in a strict sense but there are many topics which are a continuum of what the author has touched upon in Sapiens. My idea for this post is to randomly list out a few key-points from this book.</p><ol><li><p>There are some interesting stats on the number of people who were killed in war vs the ones killed by medical conditions. International peace corporations, with the collaborative help of Nations have curbed war-mongers and thus significantly reducing the number of people dying through wars and other militant activities. Humans have come to a point where sugar is more dangerous than gunpowder.</p></li><li><p>Being a software engineer coding in the applications layer of software stack, I may not be witnessing cutting edge technology at my work. This book was my gate towards some of the fields that is really upgrading humans into gods. Harari lists three important paths for this – Biological Engineering, Cyborg Engineering and the Engineering of Non-Organic beings.</p></li><li><p>My own mind amuses me everyday by making distractions that I couldn’t even have thought of , any moment other than when I actually felt it. We know mind as a flow of subjective experiences such as pain, pleasure, anger etc. Scientists still cannot explain how a bunch of electric signals in brain can result in these subjective experiences. It wasn’t just me but even scientists haven’t exactly figured out how mind works.</p></li><li><p>Humans erroneously humanize animals. The book states 90% of all large animals are domesticated. Often we have a tendency to humanize our pets. Like you thinking it waits for you to come back from work everyday or you being the center of it’s world and so on. This may be us trying hard to see another human in these pets. Perhaps that’s not what they are for. Perhaps there are other amazing qualities that they possess which we should focus on. Example of the horse <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans>Clever Hans</a> is cited to show how we misunderstood this horse to have some human level arithmetic skills, but rather what was to be amazed at was it’s ability to deduce human expressions. But also we need to note that emotions is not just a human quality. They are common to all mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes and so on.</p></li><li><p>Humanism is a central concept of the book. It’s the worship of humankind, instead of deities. The meaning of life and universe comes from within, rather than through external sources. This also leads us to do what’s best for us, prioritizing human life over other organisms and environment.</p></li><li><p>Science and Religion forms that odd couple which is important for a stable society. Every religion is created by humans to bring in some kind of order to the society. It is defined by the social function and not exactly by the deities that some worship. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Communism, Humanism are all religions with this definition. Science gives us facts, and it requires a religious assistance for a stable human society. Science tells us what is life, but doesn’t tell us how to live life. For instance, science states that humans need oxygen to survive. But is it okay to execute criminals by asphyxiation? Lately, I have been realizing the importance for everyone having a personal religion. It’s something that we define ourselves which acts as our rule-book for life. It could take ideas from different religions that we know or this could be self-defined rules that wouldn’t be shunned upon by an ethical court.</p></li><li><p>Does free will really exist? Free will is proclaimed to be every human’s right. Every action we take is our personal choice and we are accountable for it. But are we really in control of our action. The biochemical processes in our brain decides our choices even before we are aware of our intentions. These could be deterministic or random.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, it’s a great read and I would highly recommend if you are curious about the future of mankind.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
