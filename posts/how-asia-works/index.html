<span class=tag><a href=/tags/books/>books</a></span></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Not having a background in Economics definitely made this a tough read for me. I read through this book with the intent of having at least a few takeaways and not to completely internalize every single idea put forward by the author who had spent decades on the topic. Hope this review helps outsiders like me who are interested to see how policy making molds the society.
Joe Studwell&rsquo;s book has 4 chapters - first 3 focusing on three critical factors of development in Asia and 4th focusing solely on how these 3 factors played out in China. Chapter 1 focuses on agriculture, 2 on manufacturing and 3 on financial deregulation.</p><h3 id=agriculture>Agriculture:
<a class=heading-link href=#agriculture><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>The focus here is on how developing states require a different approach from mere capitalist ways of optimizing for highest return. Author cites examples of how China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan through their land policies that enabled individuals to perform household farming built out the foundation of East Asian economy. This was especially important in poor countries where most people are farmers. Household farming delivered big output and consumption boosts that empowered the economy. The rate at which countries like Japan recovered post-war is much higher than their counterparts and household agriculture played a bigger role than what one would assume. As an example, Latin America&rsquo;s efforts to industrialize were sabotaged by its low agricultural output, despite the increased manufacturing exports.
Land reforms did not serve as a secret sauce to success for post-colonial governments, who were under the political pressure of the United States. The Philippines and Indonesia were prime examples of land policy dysfunction. This chapter goes deep into the impact that land policies made in various East Asian countries and is informative and shows how the policy victory of one inspired the others to follow.</p><h3 id=manufacturing>Manufacturing:
<a class=heading-link href=#manufacturing><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Protectionism is a simple but powerful concept where countries protect their domestic manufacturers from foreign competition through measures like taxing imports. The book claims that every economically successful society has been guilty in its formative stages of protectionism. Alexander Hamilton, Founding Father of the United States who served as Treasury Secretary coined the phrase &ldquo;infant industry&rdquo; while defending protectionist policies. North-east Asian policy makers relied on the successful cookbooks from the United States and Europe while setting up their own policies. Author takes a deep dive on the story of various manufacturing conglomerates in Asia and analyzes what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. South Korean Government policies and Hyundai Motors serves as a successful case-study whereas rigid Taiwanese state policies that denied domestic protection and financial support to computer manufacturing firm Acer that subverted their plans to scale. It&rsquo;s also interesting that many of these countries employed engineers as policy makers that have helped in their technological progress.
Author takes a dig at India and its IT industry as it only employs a fraction of the total labor force and claims that a bigger focus on manufacturing industry would have been more beneficial to the Indian economy. I felt this one-off dig on the Indian economy was out of place and lacked context. It is hard to miss that the author has in general focused on East Asia, making the title of the book a bit misleading.</p><h3 id=financial-policies>Financial Policies:
<a class=heading-link href=#financial-policies><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>This is a section where a lack of economics background can really deter your understanding of the chapter. As learnt from Europe and the United States, finance had to be driven by state-led policies for success in Asia as well. There are probably more failures cited here than successes like the related-party lending in the Philippines. Berkeley Mafia, a group of Indonesian economists educated in UC Berkeley returned to their home country to carve out the foundation of their economic policies but failed to save them from the 1997 crisis.</p><h3 id=china>China:
<a class=heading-link href=#china><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>The two communist fallacies that slowed down China initially were 1) agriculture is only efficient at scale 2) manufacturing could be developed without trade. China broke out of these two beliefs and took help from the World Bank through technical support and financing that helped the growth since then.
The technology progress in China has been immense in recent years. However the sustainability of growth warrants a closer inspection. The example of two high-speed trains that collided killing many was a result of a premature technology making it into the market.</p><p>Overall this book is a solid read and shows the rigorous research that underwent to provide this 300 odd pages of valuable insights on East Asian economy.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
